# I. AWS Budget setup
- Account -> Billing and Cost Management -> Budgets : Control budget 

# Notes:
- ***Stop instance***:  After you stop the instance, you are no longer charged usage or data transfer fees for it. However, **you will still be billed for associated resources, such as attached EBS volumes and associated Elastic IP addresses**.
- If you stop an instance and then you start it later on, then AWS will maybe change its public IPv4. But, The private IP will always stay the same.

# II. EC2 Instance types
